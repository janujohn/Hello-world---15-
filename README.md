#HELLO WORLD WEB APPLICATION PROGRAM FOR 15 LANGUAGES

Basically I am a Php programmer so I know how the web application programs are running in php. I want to see how the web application programs are running in different languages. I have decided to write a simple hello world program in different languages for web.

These may not be production quality programs. The purpose is just to write a simple program  for web. I have chosen 15 languages for 15 days. I will be writing hello world program eachday using one of these
